/**
 * @file backend.h
 * @author Emilio Funes, Alexandra Barbu
 * @date 20 Oct 2024
 * @brief Interface for managing a shop's inventory, merchandise, and customer carts.
 *
 * This header file defines the core operations for managing a shop's inventory system. 
 * It provides the function declarations for creating, modifying, and removing merchandise, 
 * handling stock levels, managing customer shopping carts, and interacting with the shop's 
 * data. The shop structure consists of two hash tables: one that maps merchandise to its 
 * details (such as name, description, and price) and another that maps shelves to the 
 * merchandise they hold. The file also defines operations for cart management, 
 * including adding or removing items from carts and handling multiple customer carts.
